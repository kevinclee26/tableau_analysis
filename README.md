![sample](https://github.com/kevinclee26/tableau_analysis/blob/main/cyclist_sample.png?raw=true)

Try to create visualizations to the following questions:

What are the most dangerous hours for cyclists in a day?
* Stay home around 5PM and 6PM
* Although less incidents in the AM, they can be more deadly

What are the most dangerous months for a cyclist?
* Summer months are dangerous
* Appears to increase Y-o-Y

What are the most common causes of accidents?
* Distractions

How many people have been injured during each month?
* People are more reckless in the summer

Are there any possible problems or issues with these visualizations?
* Try to identify the number of cyclists on the road to calculate % of incident
* Appears to have a spike in incidents at midnight









# dog_analysis

![sample](https://github.com/kevinclee26/salary_analysis/blob/main/sample.png?raw=true)

Group all the breeds into small, medium, and large breeds by weight, and plot obedience on first command, minimum number of repetitions required to learn a new command, and the maximum number of repetitions required to learn a new command.

Measure dog weight as you see fit, either by lower or upper limit, or an average of both.
For the purposes of this activity, small dogs are considered to weigh up to 20 pounds, medium dogs weigh up to 60 pounds, and large dogs weigh over 60 pounds.
Create sets of small, medium, and large dog breeds and compare the obedience rate of small dogs versus non-small dogs.

Compare also small dogs' minimum and maximum repetitions versus non-small dogs
Try doing the same for large breeds versus non-large breeds
Come up with other ways to use groups and sets. Make some interesting visualizations!

What conclusions can you draw?

# Set Large to be > 60 lbs

* Less Large Dogs Breeds (58 vs 92) but have higher Obey
* Rottweiler, Papillon, Lab, Golden, Border Collie, Australian Cattle Dog are most Obey at 95


# Hypothesis

* Big == Smart? 
* Big == High Obye? 
* Big == Low Reps
* Smartest Breed ? Gold Retriever
* Lucky to be Cute ? Bulldogs / Pugs
